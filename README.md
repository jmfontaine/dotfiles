### ZSH Syntax Highlighting 

[ZSH Syntax Highlighting](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting) highlights shell commands to help reading.

* Clone repository: ``git clone git://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting.git ~/Tools``
* Source the script at the end of ``~/.zshrc``:
```bash
source ~/Tools/zsh-syntax-highlighting/zsh-syntax-highlighting.zsh
```
* Source ``~/.zshrc`` to take changes into account:
```bash
source ~/.zshrc
```

### Powerline Compatible Font

You will need to install a [Powerline-patched font](https://github.com/Lokaltog/powerline-fonts) for the ZSH theme to render correctly.

## Usage

### Sensible OS X defaults

When setting up a new Mac, you may want to set some sensible OS X defaults:

```bash
sh ~/.config/jmf/osx
```

### Install Homebrew formulae

When setting up a new Mac, you may want to install some common [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) formulae (after installing Homebrew, of course):

```bash
brew bundle ~/.brewfile
```

### Install native apps with Homebrew Cask

You could also install native apps with [Homebrew Cask](https://github.com/phinze/homebrew-cask):

```bash
sh ~/.caskfile
```

### Customize dotfiles

You can easily customize these dotfiles by copying the ``.zsh-extra.template`` to ``~/.zsh-extra`` and adding what you need in it.

Once done reload ZSH configuration:
```bash
source ~/.zshrc
```
